## Some practical issues
- Who are the users?
- What are the users'needs?
- How to generate alternative designs?
- How to choose among alternatives?
- How to integrate interaction design ativities with other lifecycle models?

### Who are the users/stakeholders?
- Not obvious
- Stakeholders

### What are the users'need?
- Users rarely know what is possible

### How to generate alternatives
- something that works
- where do alternative designs come from?
	- Flair and creativity
	- Cross-fertilization of ideas from different perspectives
	- Users can generate different designs
	- Product evolution based on changing use
	- Seek inspiration

- Balancing constraints and trade-offs

### How to choose among alternatives?
- externally-visible and measurable behavior
- Technical feasibility
- Evaluation with users or peers
- A/B Testing
- Quality thresholds

### How to integrate interaction design activities within other models
